/**
 * Round-7 — audit finding F-3: path-style deep links silently rendered Home.
 *
 * The app ships as a single static dist/index.html with no host rewrites, so
 * HashRouter stays (documented rationale in App.tsx). Links shared without
 * the hash — copied from a chat app, printed in a bulletin — arrive as
 * path-style URLs and previously rendered the Home page (a soft-404).
 *
 * `resolveHashRedirect` rewrites known path-style routes to their hash
 * equivalents before React mounts; `main.tsx` applies it via
 * location.replace so the SPA boots straight into the requested route.
 * Unknown paths keep the existing behavior — this deliberately mirrors the
 * audit's recommendation ("rewrites known path routes to their hash
 * equivalents"), not an open redirect.
 */

/**
 * Every concrete path declared in src/App.tsx (9 canonical + 7 aliases).
 * Kept in lockstep with App.tsx by the drift guard in
 * src/utils/deepLinks.test.ts — adding a route there without extending this
