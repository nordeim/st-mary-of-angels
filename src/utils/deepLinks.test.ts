 * without the hash). The router stays HashRouter — the single-file deployment
 * tradeoff documented in App.tsx — so known path-style routes are rewritten to
 * their hash equivalents before React mounts. Unknown paths keep the existing
 * behavior (out of the audit's scope: "rewrites known path routes").
